I"G<p>Upgrading COSMOS to the latest version is easy.   Every COSMOS project comes with what is called a Gemfile.   The Gemfile is used to track the library dependencies of your COSMOS project.
If your project requires a gem that is not a standard COSMOS dependency, be sure to add it to your Gemfile to track that it is a requirement of your project.  In any case, to upgrade to the latest
version of COSMOS all you need to do is run:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">bundle update cosmos</code></pre></figure>

<p>And that should get the latest version installed (unless your Gemfile has locked COSMOS to a specific version).  After upgrading, you should also look at the <a href="/docs/history">COSMOS release notes</a> to see if any other migration is required. If you would like to lock COSMOS (or any other gem) to a specific version, you can also do that with your Gemfile.   Here is an example Gemfile that
locks COSMOS to version 4.4.0, shows the ruby-termios gem requirement on non-windows systems, and also adds a project specific requirement for the sshkit gem.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>gem 'cosmos', '4.4.0'
gem 'ruby-termios' if RbConfig::CONFIG['target_os'] !~ /mswin|mingw|cygwin/i
gem 'sshkit'
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, whenever you receive a new COSMOS project, running the following command will ensure you have everything you need installed to run that configuration.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">bundle <span class="nb">install</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>For more information on Gemfiles and managing dependencies for a COSMOS (or any other Ruby-based) project see the bundler documentation at:
